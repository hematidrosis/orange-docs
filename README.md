# Orange

This is the documentation for the Orange programming language. Orange is an imperative, statically typed systems programming language that aims to be productive and powerful without all the clunkyness of C++.  

Orange is still a work in progress and still under design changes; each relevant section will be noted with its implementation status. Section will either be marked as `Design Phase` for things that are still being designed, `Not Implemented` for things that are designed but not implemented, and `Implemented` for things that have been implemented into the code.

As Orange is not yet stable, the syntax for any feature, including implemented ones, can change over time.
