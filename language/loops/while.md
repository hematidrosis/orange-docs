# While Loops
**STATUS**: Implemented

While loops are similar to for loops, but only with the condition component of the loop:

    while _condition_
        [[ _code_ ]]
    end 

Like `for` and `forever` loops, `while` loops support one-line loops:

    _code_ while _condition_

Similarly to `for` loops, the condition of the while loop must be a boolean type.
