# Strings
**STATUS**: Implemented

Strings in Orange are similar to strings in other programming language: any content wrapped in double quotes count as a string. As status in [Source Format](source_format.md), strings support Unicode encoded in UTF-8. Strings are data primitives and have no methods associated with them. The Orange Standard Library will provide a `String` class that can be used for string operations.

The type of a string is `char[]` (equivalent to `int8[]`).
