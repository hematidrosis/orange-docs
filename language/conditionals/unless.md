# Unless Statement

    # or 

    _code_ unless _condition_

The unless statement is similar to an if statement, but the body of the if statement is always executed _unless_ the condition is true. That is, the body is executed if and only if the condition is false. 

Unlike `if` statements, `unless` statements do not support `else`.
